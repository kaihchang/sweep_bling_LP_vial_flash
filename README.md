# sweep_bling_LP_vial_flash
This is my first time making my own split keyboard from open-source files. Edited and ordered PCB and components myself.
Assembled a Ferris Sweep Bling LP with a pro micro. Flashed QMK first, then Vial.

How I ordered components:
1. get kicad file from https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep
2. edit however you like, generate gerber, and order from JLCPCB, or any other PCB manufacturers.
3. shop everything else from Taobao.
   $15 for 40 switches: https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a21n57.1.0.0.78b8523c7g3Dys&id=712811327709&ns=1&abbucket=12#detail

   Plus PCB for $4 and TRRS stuffs at local shop here (it was around $5 in total), the whole thing should cost about $33.
