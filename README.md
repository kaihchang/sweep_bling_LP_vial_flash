# sweep_bling_LP_vial_flash
This is my first time making my own split keyboard from open-source files. Edited and ordered PCB and components myself.
Assembled a Ferris Sweep Bling LP with a pro micro. Flashed QMK first, then Vial.

ZMK version (currently private):
https://github.com/kaihchang/zmk-config

Cases and stands I re-designed from existing open files:

Keymap I use:

How I ordered components:
1. get kicad file from https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep
2. edit however you like, generate gerber, and order from JLCPCB, or any other PCB manufacturers.
3. shop everything else from Taobao.
